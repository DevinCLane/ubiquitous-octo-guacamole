Experimenting with git workflows:
- Cloning a repository to local machine with SSH
- Verifying the remote of my local copy with `git remote -v`
- Reading contents of `git status` as I work
- `git add <filename>`, `git add .`, and `git commit -m "commit message here"`
- Reading the contents of `git log` to see the details of commits and their authors
- `git push` to upload the work!
